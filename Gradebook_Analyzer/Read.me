Gradebook Analyzer

A simple Python script that records student marks for a set of subjects, computes totals and averages, assigns letter grades, and shows pass/fail lists.


Collects: number of students and subjects, subject names, student names, and marks for each subject.
Calculates per-student totals and averages.
Assigns letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) using these cutoffs: A >= 90, B >= 80, C >= 70, D >= 60, otherwise F.
Shows a simple tab-separated results table, class statistics (class average, highest/lowest totals) and pass/fail lists (pass if average >= 40).
